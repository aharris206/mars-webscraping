## Calculating the Length of a Year on Mars
- Solar Longitude `(Ls)` can be used to much more accurately determine the length of a year on Mars! The Equinoxes happen on Ls = 0° & 180°, and the Solstices happen on Ls = 90° & 270°. You can read more about ['the definition of a year on Mars here'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timekeeping_on_Mars#Definition_of_year_and_seasons)

### Fun Fact! 
- Mars has a thin atmosphere that consists prodominantly of CO₂ (nearly 96%). 
- Because of the ['thermodynamic properties'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_(data_page)#Thermodynamic_properties) of CO₂, it transitions from solid to gas `sublimation` and gas to solid `deposition` at pressures below 518.5 kPa, which is five times more pressure then that of our atmosphere on Earth at sea level *a perfact example of this is Dry Ice which is solid CO₂* 
- **Because of this**, the atmosphere on Mars ***deposits*** becoming a solid around the poles in their respective Winter, and then eventually **sublimes** transitioning back to a gas in their respective Spring! We know that ice caps we see on Mars contain *some* water, but they are ***mostly*** dry ice from the atmosphere becoming solid!
